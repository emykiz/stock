We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer.

<p><strong>Evolution</strong></p>
<p>Customers are eligible for a refund if their accounts meet both of the following criteria: the account has not been traded on; the account is less than 14 days old. If the account has been traded on, the Customer loses refund eligibility and the Service is regarded as used. This refund policy is standardised in accordance with UK/EU consumer protection regulation. If the account has been traded on, or the 14 day period surpasses, the account is classed as &#8216;used&#8217; and the Customer can claim a maximum 50% refund. A Customer is only entitled to this partial refund if their issued demo trading account is not in drawdown. For instance, the balance of the account must be at least equal to the initial issued balance, with all trades closed. If the Customer’s demo trading account is in drawdown or has been closed due to violating the program rules, the Customer is not entitled to a refund of fees under any circumstances.  Customers are eligible for our refund policy, if the criteria set out within our Guidelines are met, within 45 days days of the payment date. Customers are not eligible for refunds after this 45 day period. Additionally, the refund total equals the 50% fee less any profits received. Thus, once a Customer has received, at least, the equivalent in payouts to the fee paid to start the Service, they will no longer be eligible for a refund. If a refund is requested and the Customer meets our eligibility criteria, they will forfeit the remaining profit, if any, that is existent on their account. Customers are not eligible for a refund, if at the Company&#8217;s discretion, they have misused the Service or have taken advantage of the refund policy for short term financial gain.</p>
<p><strong>Quickstart</strong></p>
<p>Customers are eligible for a refund if their accounts meet both of the following criteria: the account has not been traded on; the account is less than 14 days old. If the account has been traded on, the Customer loses refund eligibility and the Service is regarded as used. This refund policy is standardised in accordance with UK/EU consumer protection regulation.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Customers who request a refund are obliged to cover transfer fees including but not limited to: card fees, international transfer fees, bank fees, crypto fees and gas fees for both credit and debit transactions. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to decline refund to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction without explanation. If a Customer is eligible and requests a refund, the issuance of a refund will signal the end of their access to their account, platform and all other services provided by the Company. Accounts opened via credit from generated profit, store credit or gift cards are not refundable under any circumstances. In this situation, all sales are final.</p>
<p>All refund requests are reviewed by our team before processing. If a refund request is submitted, please allow up to 7 working days for our team to manually review an account, cancel any active agreement and complete any other related task before which may be necessary, such as requesting more information from a Customer, before initiating a refund. If a refund request is successful, the Customer will receive notification from the Company to which a refund will be processed. Once a Customer places a refund request, their account is placed in read-only mode until request is reviewed. The account will only be reconnected on the express notification by the Company.</p>
<p>Refund times are subject to standard bank and processor handling times. Once the initial seven day review period is completed and a refund processed, please allow up to ten business days for the funds to show in your account. Only contact support if this time has elapsed and the refund has not yet hit your account. In this case, they may contact support@stocknetinstitute.com who can assist further.</p>
<p>If the Customer lodges a complaint regarding the fee paid or disputes this with the Customer’s bank or payment service provider (through chargeback services, dispute services or other similar services) on the basis of which an annulment, cancellation or refund of the fee or any part thereof is requested, the Company is entitled, at its own discretion, to stop providing to the Customer any Services or entitlements herein and refuse any future Services.</p>
<h3>Trading Behaviour</h3>
<p>We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sale of our products or Services, including termination of active accounts, to any person who misuses our systems. This includes the use of expert advisors which damage, take advantage of and/or jeopardise the backend systems of Stocknet Institute or its technical partners. This also includes any trading behaviour which aims to benefit from inefficiencies in platform or servers. These activities can also include, but are not limited to, trade spamming, latency arbitrage trading, long-short arbitrage trading, stop order arbitrage, gap trading, spread arbitrage, reverse arbitrage, tick scalping and opposite trading between accounts. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This also constitutes opening a minimum of one buy and sell position on the same instrument within 10 seconds of the first operation, as well as opening and closing the same position in 5 seconds or under. This type of trading cannot be replicated on our central fund, can lead to excess loss of capital due to factors like slippage and is, therefore, a banned trading system. This is also applicable for correlated markets, for example, buying and selling a single asset, such as USD, at the same time across different positions. An example of this would be buying GBPUSD and selling EURUSD within 10 seconds of each other. This is deemed an arbitraging trading system which cannot be replicated on live markets and is thus not allowed. We reserve the right to remove our Services and/or permanently ban Customers who continue using a strategy which has been breached for any of the respective points listed above. This includes, but is not limited to, continuing to use the same strategy but altering close times to operate just within the allowed close times or hedge times (using the same strategy but closing trades regularly just over 5 seconds or hedging regularly just over 10 seconds); this marks no considerable effort to cooperate and is deemed as both irresponsible and rule-bending. </span></p>
<p>We reserve the right to terminate the account and limit the sales of products and Services to customers who breach these criteria. Any Customer found using a banned trading style or system will be issued a hard breach and will lose access to their account instantly, at the Company&#8217;s discretion. Customer accounts which get terminated will not be able to access refunds and will not receive compensation under such circumstances, such as payment for profit generated on the account.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to limit our Services and cancel the contract of any Customer who operates an &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; approach to trading and risk management. This includes largely over-risking positions in the pursuit of fast, short term profits without using appropriate risk management. This can include using the full drawdown allowance or higher as the open risk on a trade (8% for Evolution accounts). It also includes using extremely high volume position sizes which do not corroborate with an account size, without a protective stop loss. This &#8216;gambling&#8217; is not the style of trading we are looking for and this process puts the Company at high risk of excessive loss of capital. The capital in which we issue is the property of the Company and any account can be subject to review and termination at any time should the Customer be deemed to be irresponsible with an account. The Company can decide to disable an account which is deemed high risk or irresponsible as well as removing scaling where necessary. Likewise, the Company have the right to close positions, balance trades, reduce leverage or open new positions to manage risk on an account which is deemed to be gambling. Profit from trades made through gambling or excessive over leveraging with poor risk management may be removed from the Customer&#8217;s account at the Company&#8217;s discretion. Customer can receive large sums of Company capital and therefore have a responsibility to be responsible, as such, we do not allow styles that are high risk and have zero tolerance to gambling.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to limit the further issuance of capital to traders who are deemed to pose an elevated risk to excess loss of capital. We may, where necessary, issue a temporary time out, prevent scaling to larger accounts temporarily or permanently, or hold traders on a specific account size, if they have a history of poor trading, poor risk management, account spamming, a high percentage of breached accounts or a high account turnover rate. This decisions is made where we believe, based on the decision of our trading team, that the rate of scaling does not corroborate with overall trading history, such as an overwhelmingly high breach rate. We may, where we find necessary, ask a trader to remain on an account size for a prolonged period, to assess their strategy over a longer period of time. This is particularly pertinent for traders who have scaled through accounts rapidly and their strategy has not proven any long term sustainability. The capital issued belongs to Stocknet FX Limited and, thus, decisions on it issuance lies solely with the Company.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to withdraw our Services at any time to Customers we believe to be &#8216;Account Spamming&#8217;. This rule includes consistently spamming trades, experiencing frequent breaches and frequently opening new accounts, referred to as &#8216;account turnover rate&#8217;.  Account turnover rate = (Total accounts opened / Time in weeks). If the account turnover rate exceeds a ratio 3:1, the Company reserves the right to limit the services to the Customer at its own discretion at any time. Customers who break the Account Spamming rule will have their accounts breached and risk being permanently banned.</p>
<p><strong>Expert Advisors</strong></p>
<p>Customers may use expert advisors, bots and trade copiers when using our Services. Expert advisors must comply with the respective program rules of the Service in which the Customer has purchased. Trade copiers can be used from any account, even if the Customer is not the owner of the Master account, or if the Master account is not in the Customer&#8217;s name. As such, our accounts may be used as either a slave or master account. Our Evolution program allows for the automatic  copy of operations between other Evolution accounts, to the total of three accounts per strategy. If the same operations are being placed on more than 3 Evolution accounts, we reserve the right to close all accounts utilising the same strategy without warning, issuing account breaches, resulting is disqualification. Whilst Customers are free to copy trades from external sources onto Quickstart accounts, Customers may not copy trades between Quickstart accounts; doing so will result in an account breach of all accounts involved and subsequent disqualification.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to ban any expert advisor, trade copier, robot or algorithm which causes damage to our central fund and/or brokerage servers. This includes, but is not limited to, expert advisors which execute a banned trading style (trade spamming, latency arbitrage trading, long-short arbitrage trading, stop order arbitrage, gap trading, spread arbitrage, reverse arbitrage, tick scalping and opposite trading between accounts), any expert advisor which causes severe loss of our capital or any expert advisor which damages the server through pumping, trade spamming or pending order spamming. Expert advisors are constantly review by the Company staff and the Company&#8217;s automated risk management system to flag for elevated-risk or damaging expect advisor use. If an expert advisor is flagged as damaging or risk-elevated, for any of the reasons listed previously, we reserve the right to ask the Customer for cooperation in providing information on their expert advisor, its strategy and/or system and the source code. Failure to cooperate and/or provide satisfactory information assumes the use of a banned trading style may lead to disqualification. Expert advisors which cause large discrepancies due to unaccepted trading styles may be banned and any accounts using such a system may receive account breaches and disqualification, with profit forfeited. Customers may be asked, at the Company&#8217;s discretion, to trade manually and the option of using an expert advisor may be removed for a Customer indefinitely.</p>

In no case shall Stocknet FX Limited, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<h3>Indemnification and Severability</h3>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.</p>
<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.</p>
<p>If in our sole judgement you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).</p>
<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.</p>
<h3>Contracts and Legal</h3>
<p>Customers who purchase products or Services and sign independent contractor agreements with the Company are bound to the sections of these Terms of Service. It is the customer&#8217;s responsibility to read and understand the Terms of Service before signing any contract, and, by signing the contract, therefore, agree with these Terms. In event of Company closure, each Customer will be entitled to any residing profit on an account at the respective split, but will not be eligible to receive a refund under any circumstances.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the user&#8217;s legal jurisdiction.</p>
